## The Conceptual Church Map (CCM)

The Conceptual Church Map (CCM) is an key visualisation output that was designed to meet the specific mapping requirements for research undertaken from the Human Remains Digital Library.

It represents - as the name implies - a conceptual model of the key institutional spaces found across typical churches, allowing for a simple representation of data - compiled or comparitive - without the need for layouts at an individual building level.

## Folder Contents
This Home folder contains supporting tables and figures for the core published output of the research undertaken by the project.

- **cathedrals_stats** : the number of documents found in initial text sweeps, duplicates discarded, and those that provided records for the digital library.

- **metadata_capture_values** : the metadata field definitions captured for each record in the digital library, and their corresponding Dublin Core options.

- **online_archives_consulted** : a list of all digital resources from which material was collected for conversion into records, and the subcorpora for which they were specifically targetted.

- **searchterms_all_languages** : a compiled index and corresponding regex forms of the five non-Modern English languages and their distinct key terms, used for text sweeps across various online archives.

- **sourcecreate_flow** : an outline of the process by which records were formed from documents containing relevant material. Also provided in a visual form.

- **subcorpora_stats** : the number of records found/created for each dedicated subcorpus that comprise the digital library.

- **variantrules_welsh** : the spelling variations determined to encompass linguistic change - as applicable to the key terms over the comparitive period (8th - 20th Century).

- **welsh_variants_generated** : the lexical morphologies generated from the variantrules_welsh as applied to the Welsh entries from searchterms_all_languages.




## Compiled Subcorpora
These separate repositories hold the texts (in both original languages where appropriate and modern english translations as feature in the digital library) collected by individual researchers for each focused subcorpora, provided in raw .txt format with corresponding record list in xlsx.

- **metadata_capture_values** : the metadata fields definitions captured for each record in the digital library, and their corresponding Dublin Core fields.

- **online_archives_consulted** : a list of all digital resources from which material was collected for conversion into suitable records, and the subcorpora they were specifically targetted for.

- **sourcecreate_flow** : an outline of the process by which a relevant text was divided into constituent records. Also provided in a visual form.

- **subcorpora_stats** : the number of records found/created for each dedicated subcorpus that comprise the digital library.
